So if I were to create some variables, those variables get added to the graph (and may that variable the is the sum of two other variables). So what the graph will define now is \"Variable 1 = Variable 2 + Variable 3\". However, we only know the function exists but we don't know anything else about it (such as 7 = 3 + 4). In other words, we haven't evulated it yet. <br>\n",
